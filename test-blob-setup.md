# Testing Blob Storage Setup

## What Changed

1. **Default Blob Storage**: All audio files now use blob storage by default for consistent experience
2. **No Size Limits**: Eliminates "Response too large" errors
3. **Automatic Fallback**: Only falls back to inline delivery for very small files (<1MB) if blob storage fails
4. **Better Error Messages**: More helpful error messages when blob storage isn't configured

## Expected Behavior

### With Blob Storage Configured:
- ✅ All audio files uploaded to Vercel Blob storage
- ✅ Returns `audioUrl` pointing to blob storage
- ✅ Frontend automatically fetches and converts to base64
- ✅ No size limit errors

### Without Blob Storage Configured:
- ❌ Returns error: "BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN environment variable is required"
- ❌ Includes helpful message about setting up environment variables

## Setup Steps

1. **Create Vercel Blob Store**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard > Storage > Blob
   - Create new blob store
   - Copy the Read-Write Token

2. **Set Environment Variable**:
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Environment Variables section
   - Add: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` = your token
   - Apply to: Production, Preview, Development

3. **Redeploy**:
   - Push changes or manually redeploy
   - Test with audio generation

## Debug Information

The API now logs:
- File sizes being processed
- Whether blob storage is attempted
- Success/failure of blob uploads
- Fallback attempts

Check your Vercel function logs to see what's happening.

## Testing

Try generating speech with different text lengths:
- Short text (should work with blob storage)
- Medium text (should work with blob storage)  
- Long text (should work with blob storage, no size limits)

All should now work consistently without "Response too large" errors.
