# YouTube Extraction Troubleshooting

## Common Issue: "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"

This error occurs when YouTube's anti-bot protection blocks automated requests. This is a **temporary issue** that usually resolves itself.

### ✅ Quick Solutions

1. **Wait and Retry** (Most Effective)
   - Wait 5-10 minutes and try again
   - YouTube's blocks are usually temporary

2. **Try Different Videos**
   - Use popular, public videos
   - Avoid private, unlisted, or age-restricted content
   - Shorter videos (under 5 minutes) work better

3. **Use Alternative Videos**
   - Try music from different channels
   - Look for official music videos or popular uploads

### 🎯 Best Practices for Success

**✅ Videos that work well:**
- Popular music videos
- Official artist channels
- Public, non-restricted content
- Videos under 10 minutes
- Recently uploaded content

**❌ Videos to avoid:**
- Private or unlisted videos
- Age-restricted content
- Very long videos (>10 minutes)
- Videos with copyright restrictions
- Live streams

### 🔧 Technical Details

YouTube uses sophisticated bot detection that can temporarily block automated requests. This affects all YouTube downloaders, not just our app. The blocking is usually:

- **Temporary** (5-30 minutes)
- **IP-based** (affects your location)
- **Volume-based** (triggered by many requests)

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Spread out usage** - Don't process many videos in quick succession
2. **Use popular content** - Well-known songs are less likely to be blocked
3. **Try different times** - YouTube blocking varies by time of day
4. **Be patient** - The service works best when not rushed

### 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If you continue to experience problems:

1. **Check video accessibility** - Can you watch it normally in your browser?
2. **Try incognito mode** - Test the video in a private browser window
3. **Use different videos** - Some videos are simply not accessible to downloaders
4. **Wait longer** - Sometimes blocks can last up to an hour

Remember: This is a limitation of YouTube's anti-bot systems, not a bug in our application. The same issue affects all similar services.
